**Project Title :**
Building a Speech-to-Text System with
Integrated Language Modeling for Improved
Accuracy in Transcription Services
**Description :**
# ivr-speech-to-text
This project implements a Speech-to-Text transcription system tailored for Customer Service Automation (IVR Systems). It leverages Wav2Vec2 to transcribe IVR audio commands, even in noisy environments like call centers. It includes audio preprocessing, noise augmentation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and transcription quality evaluation using Word Error Rate (WER).
**Key Features**

Adds background noise (e.g., office, call center) to clean IVR audio

Uses Facebook's Wav2Vec2 pretrained model for speech recognition

Supports audio preprocessing, augmentation, and waveform/spectrogram visualization

Evaluates transcription quality using Word Error Rate (WER)
**Technologies**

Python, PyTorch

HuggingFace Transformers (Wav2Vec2)

Librosa, SoundFile, JiWER

Domain: Customer Service Automation (IVR Systems)
